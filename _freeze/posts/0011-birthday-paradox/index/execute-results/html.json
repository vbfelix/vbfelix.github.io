We can generalize the @eq-pair-23 to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\n&= \\frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!}  \\\\\n&= \\frac{n\\times(n-1)\\times(n-2)!}{2(n-2)!} \\\\\n&= \\frac{n\\times(n-1)}{2}. \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$ {#eq-pair-n}\n\nThen, we use the @eq-pair-n in @eq-pair-same-birthday:\n\n$$\n1 - \\left(\\frac{364}{365}\\right)^{\\frac{n\\times(n-1)}{2}}.\n$$ {#eq-birthday-paradox}\n\nFinally, with @eq-birthday-paradox we can see the probability behavior as the group size changes.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
