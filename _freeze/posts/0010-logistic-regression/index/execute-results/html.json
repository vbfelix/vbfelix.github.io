Besides that, we can also see that the logit function is actually the logarithm of the odds $\\frac{p}{1-p}$.\n\n# Application\n\n> **Disclaimer:** because the goal of this article is to introduce logistics regression, some topics such as classification, accuracy, goodness of fit, intercept, and others will not be covered.\n\nTo apply in a real-world scenario, we will use the data set of the Titanic passengers [@datasets], which consists of 2,201 passengers with the following characteristics:\n\n-   **Class**: Crew, 3rd, 2nd and 1st;\n\n-   **Sex**: Male and Female;\n\n-   **Age**: Child and Adult;\n\n-   **Survived**: No and Yes.\n\nThe limited availability of lifeboats and the overall evacuation procedures influenced the decision-making process for which Titanic passengers were saved during the disaster. There were not enough lifeboats to accommodate all of the passengers and crew when the Titanic collided with an iceberg and began to sink.\n\nThe Titanic only had 20 lifeboats, with a total capacity of roughly half the number of passengers.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nBefore we begin modeling, let's take a look at our data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe majority of passengers (95.05%) were adults, with children accounting for a smaller proportion (4.95%). The crew class had the most members (40.21%), followed by the third class (32.08%), first class (14.77%), and second class (12.95%). Male passengers made up 78.65% of the total, while females made up 21.35%.\n\nAccording to the survival rate, 32.30% of passengers survived the disaster, while 67.70% did not.\n\nThis graph sheds light on the demographics of the Titanic passengers, but our main goal here is to try to discover survival patterns based on those characteristics, so let's first look at the survival rate for each level and variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=864}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nEven though they made up less than 5% of the passengers, children had a higher survival rate (52.29%).\n\nFirst-class passengers had the highest survival rate (62.46%), followed by second-class passengers (41.40%), indicating that the survival rate of class had a hierarchical behavior.\n\nFemale passengers had a significantly higher survival rate (73.19%) than male passengers (21.20%).\n\nThese findings highlight the varying effects of age, ticket class, and gender on survival during the Titanic disaster, with children, first-class passengers, and female passengers having a better chance of survival, despite not constituting the majority of passengers.\n\nThe evacuation procedure followed the \"*women and children firs*t\" policy, which prioritized women, children, and some crew members were exempt from this policy.\n\nThere were exceptions, with some men allowed on lifeboats if space was available or if they boarded without opposition. Confusion and miscommunication resulted in inefficient use of lifeboat spaces. As a result, many passengers, particularly lower-class men, were left on the sinking ship, risking their lives.\n\nNow, we will try to consider all this factors in a single model to understand the effect of each one in the survival of this tragedy.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> term </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> estimate </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> ageAdult </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> -1.0615 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> class3rd </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> -0.9201 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> class2nd </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> -0.1604 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> class1st </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0.8577 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> sexFemale </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 2.4201 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFirst of all we see the estimate of the coefficients ($\\beta_i$) for each variable, and because all variables are categoricals, we have a baseline for each one that serves as the reference level. But what do these figures mean?\n\n## Odds ratio\n\nTo better understand the practical implications of the coefficients, we can apply the exponential function to the coefficients to obtain the odds ratios.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOdds ratio (OR)\n\n:   *The odds ratio indicates how much the outcome odds change for a one-unit increase in the predictor variable (for continuous predictors) or when moving from one category to another (for categorical predictors).*\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere is why, let's say we have two logit's ($p_1$ and $p_2$), and we will subtract one from another, so:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{logit}_{p_1} - \\mathrm{logit}_{p_2} \n&= \\log \\left( \\frac{p_1}{1-p_1}\\right) - \\log \\left( \\frac{p_2}{1-p_2}\\right)\\\\\n&= \\log \\left( \\frac{p_1}{1-p_1}\\middle/ \\frac{p_2}{1-p_2}\\right).\\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$ {#eq-logit-to-log-or}\n\nSo the difference between two logit functions is the logarithm of an odds ratio, which means that we can get the OR by applying an exponential function to the coefficients of a logistic model.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> term </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> estimate </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> OR </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> ageAdult </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> -1.0615 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0.3459 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> class3rd </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> -0.9201 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0.3985 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> class2nd </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> -0.1604 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0.8518 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> class1st </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0.8577 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 2.3577 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> sexFemale </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 2.4201 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 11.2465 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow that we have the OR of each level compared to their respective baseline (reference level), we can interpret them by looking at their magnitude, where if is:\n\n-   equal to 1, it means that the predictor variable has no effect on the outcome odds;\n\n-   greater than 1, it indicates an increase in the odds of the outcome;\n\n-   less than 1, it indicates a decrease in the odds of the outcome.\n\nLet's take the example of an Adult in the model, it has a 34,59% chance to survive in comparison to a child (reference level), that means that being an adult reduces the odds of the outcome by approximately 65.4%.\n\nSo we can easily measure the impact by doing OR-1; if negative, the odds of the outcome are reduced; if positive, the odds of the outcome are increased.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> term </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> estimate </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> OR </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> OR-1 </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> ageAdult </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> -1.0615 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0.3459 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> -0.6541 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> class3rd </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> -0.9201 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0.3985 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> -0.6015 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> class2nd </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> -0.1604 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0.8518 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> -0.1482 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> class1st </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0.8577 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 2.3577 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 1.3577 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> sexFemale </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 2.4201 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 11.2465 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 10.2465 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs previously stated, being an adult reduced the odds of the outcome by approximately 65.4% when compared to being a child.\n\nPassengers in the third class have their odds reduced by approximately 60.2% when compared to the crew, while passengers in the second class have their odds reduced by approximately 14.8%. Being in the first class, on the other hand, increases the odds of the outcome by approximately 135.8%.\n\nSex had the greatest impact, with being female increased the odds by approximately 1,024.7% when compared to being male.\n\n# Considerations\n\nLogistic regression is an effective method for modeling binary phenomena.\n\nIts ease of use and interpretability make it an appealing option for estimating probabilities and understanding the relationships between predictors and odds.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that logistic regression assumes independence and linearity, which limits its applicability to complex nonlinear relationships and dependent data. When using logistic regression in practical scenarios, it is critical to carefully consider these benefits and drawbacks, especially when using to predict/classify something.\n",
