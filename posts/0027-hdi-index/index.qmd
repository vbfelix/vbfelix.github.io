In this post we explore the formula of the Human Development Index (HDI).

# Context

The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite statisticused to rank and gauge the social and economic development of nations. As part of its yearly Human Development Report, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) created it.

In 2010 a new version was published, combining three dimensions:

-   Health

-   Education

-   Economy

# Health

To measure Health the metric choosen was the Life Expectancy Index (LEI), given by:

$$
\begin{align}
\mathrm{LEI}
&=  \frac{\mathrm{LE}-20}{65},\\
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-lei}

where:

-   LE = Life expectancy at birth, in years;

-   20 = Minimum life expectancy threshold, historically observed globally;

-   85 = Maximum life expectancy threshold, historically observed globally.

Given the @eq-lei, a LE of 85 years would mean a LEI of 1, and if the LE is 20 the LEI is zero.

```{r, echo = FALSE}

lei_function <- function(x){(x-20)/65}
ilei_function <- function(x){(x*65)+20}

le  <- 1:100
lei <- lei_function(le)

health_df <- 
  tibble(
    le = le,
    lei = lei
  )

health_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(le,lei))+
  geom_line(linewidth = 1)+
  plt_theme_xy()+
  plt_flip_y_title+
  plt_pinpoint(y = c(0,1), x = ilei_function(c(0,1)))+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(seq(0,100,10),85), expand = c(.01,0))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-1,2,.1), expand = c(.01,0))+
  labs(x = "LE", y = "LEI")+
  plt_water_mark(vfx_watermark)
```

# Education

To measure Education the metric choosen was the Education Index (EI), to understand it, first we need to explore two other metrics.

First, the Mean Years of Schooling Index (MYSI) given by:

$$ \begin{align} \mathrm{MYSI} &=  \frac{\mathrm{MYS}}{15},\\ \end{align} $$ {#eq-mysi}

where

-   $\mathrm{MYS}$ = Mean Years of Schooling, i.e., refers to the average number of completed years of formal education by people aged 25 and older;

-   15 is the projected maximum of this indicator for 2025.

Next, the Expected Years of Schooling Index (EYSI), given by:

$$ \begin{align} \mathrm{EYSI} &=  \frac{\mathrm{EYS}}{18},\\ \end{align} $$ {#eq-eysi}

where

-   $\mathrm{EYS}$ = Expected Years of Schooling, i.e., refers to the number of years a child of school entrance age is expected to spend at school, or university, including years spent on repetition.

-   18 is equivalent to achieving a master's degree in most countries.

Finally, the EI is given by the mean of MYSI and EYSI:

$$ \begin{align} \mathrm{EI} &=  \frac{\mathrm{MYSI}+\mathrm{EYSI}}{2},\\ \end{align} $$ {#eq-ei}

where:

-   $\mathrm{MYSI}$ = Mean Years of Schooling Index;

-   $\mathrm{EYSI}$ = Expected Years of Schooling Index.

# Economy

To measure Economy the metric choosen was the Income Index (II), given by:

$$ \begin{align} \mathrm{II} &=  \frac{\ln(\mathrm{GNI_{pc}})-\ln(100)}{\ln(75000)-\ln(100)},\\ \end{align} $$

where:

-   $\ln$ = natural logarithm function;

-   $\mathrm{GNI_{pc}}$ = Gross national income at purchasing power parity per capita, in dollars.

So, the Income Index is 1 when $\mathrm{GNI_{pc}}$ is US\$75,000 and 0 when is US\$100.

```{r, echo = FALSE}

ii_function <- function(x){(log(x)-log(100))/log(750) }

gni_pc  <- seq(100,100000,by = 100)

gni_ref <-  c(100,75000)

economy_df <- 
  tibble(
    gni_pc = gni_pc,
    ii = ii_function(gni_pc)
  )

economy_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(gni_pc,ii))+
  geom_line(linewidth = 1)+
  plt_theme_xy()+
  plt_flip_y_title+
  plt_pinpoint(y = ii_function(gni_ref), x = gni_ref)+
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = seq(0,100000,by = 20000),
    labels = seq(0,100000,by = 20000) %>%  format_num(digits = 0),
    expand = c(.05,0),
    sec.axis = sec_axis(trans = ~.,breaks = gni_ref, labels = format_num(gni_ref,digits = 0))
    )+
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = seq(-1,2,.1),
    expand = c(.01,0)
    )+
  labs(x = "Gross national income at purchasing power parity per capita, in dollars", y = "II")+
  plt_water_mark(vfx_watermark)

```
