Now let's compare to the expected result.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs we can see Benford's Law is very similar to our data, but is this always the case?\n\n## Uniform distribution\n\nNow let's simulate a set of 10,000 random numbers from a uniform distribution with a range from 1 to 100.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nHere we can the simulated data:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow let's calculate the frequency of the first digits.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can now see that the law deviates from the simulated data, but why? Because we are sampling from a set of numbers where the first digit pool is equal, the probability of the law working increases as the range increases and includes only a portion of the numbers in the first digit or the data is random.\n\n# Considerations\n",
