Its goal was to get past the constraints of Hadoop MapReduce, and in 2010 it was made available to the public.\n\nAfter becoming a member of the Apache Software Foundation in 2013, Spark advanced to the Apache Incubator and, in 2014, became a Top-Level Apache Project, demonstrating its maturity. DataFrames and Datasets were added to Spark 2.0 (2016) to improve usability.\n\nAs it continues to add new features and enhancements, Apache Spark is still a well-known big data framework, with SQL analytics capabilities, which outperforms many conventional data warehouses in executing quick, distributed ANSI SQL queries for tasks like dashboarding and *ad hoc* reporting.\n\n# Why use Spark?\n\n## **Speed and Performance**\n\n-   ***In-memory processing**:* Spark utilizes in-memory processing, accelerating data manipulation by storing data in memory, leading to faster data pipelines compared to disk-based systems.\n\n-   ***Unified Engine**:* Spark offers a unified engine for batch processing, streaming, and machine learning, eliminating the need to switch between different tools and reducing overall processing time.\n\n-   ***Fault tolerance**:* Spark is designed to be fault-tolerant, automatically recovering from failures and ensuring reliable data processing.\n\n## **Flexibility and Scalability**\n\n-   ***Supports various data sources**:* Spark can integrate with diverse data sources, including files, databases, cloud storage, and real-time streams, enhancing flexibility for data ingestion and analysis.\n\n-   ***Runs on various platforms**:* Spark is adaptable to different hardware configurations, running on single machines, clusters, and cloud platforms, ensuring scalability.\n\n-   ***Supports multiple programming languages**:* Spark has support for Scala, Python, Java, and R allows developers to choose the language they are most comfortable with, enhancing flexibility.\n\n## **Other Benefits**\n\n-   ***Active community**:* Spark boasts a large and active community, providing ample resources and support for learning and troubleshooting.\n\n-   ***Open source**:* Spark is an open-source software, freely available for use and modification, reducing licensing costs and fostering community collaboration.\n",
