Let us now compare the actual result to the expected result.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs we can see, Benford's Law and our data are very similar, but is this always the case?\n\n## Uniform distribution\n\nLet's run a simulation of 10,000 random numbers drawn from a uniform distribution with a range of 1 to 100.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nThe simulated data is shown below:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet us now compute the frequency of the first digits.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see now that the law differs from the simulated data, but why? Because we are sampling from a set of numbers where the first digit pool is uniform.\n\n# Considerations\n\nBenford's Law is applicable to datasets with broad value ranges but may not work well with datasets with narrow value ranges.\n\nBecause its distribution patterns are sensitive to data scale, it is less effective when data is not spread across multiple orders of magnitude. Intentional data manipulation can reduce the accuracy of fraud detection, necessitating the use of additional investigative techniques.\n\nWhile it primarily analyzes first digits, it can also analyze second and subsequent digits, though with potentially less robust results.\n\nBenford's Law should be used with caution, taking into account the specific data context, because different data types exhibit different statistical patterns, and blind application may result in incorrect conclusions.\n",
