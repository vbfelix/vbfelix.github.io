In this post, we will dive into the pages of John Doerr's book Measure What Matters.

# Context

John Doerr is a well-known American venture capitalist who works for Kleiner Perkins, a leading venture capital firm. He rose to prominence as an early investor in technology companies such as Google, Amazon, and Netscape.

Doerr is also associated with popularizing the Objectives and Key Results (OKR) goal-setting system, which is covered in the book and will be discussed in depth in this post.

# 1.OKR's in Action

## 1.01.Google, Meet OKR's

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yogi Berra

:   *If you don't know where you are going, you might wind up someplace else.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

John begins this chapter by telling us how he invested in Google when it was still a startup. He goes on to explain how, despite being disruptive and having a lot of potential due to the technological advantage (PageRank algorithm), they lacked management experience.

Then he introduces the OKR methodology, which he used at Intel and saved him at Sun Microsystems. He describes it as a protocol for defining goals that is useful for businesses, teams, and individuals. Even though he uses the term "saves", the methodology is merely a guide, not a replacement for aspects such as leadership, creative culture, and common sense.

An objective (O) is a goal that must be met. Because it can be a broad statement, key results (KR) will be used to monitor and predict when the goal will be met, and they must then be measured and concisely expressed in a number.

Beyond being a monitoring tool, the book includes examples of how clear goals can have positive environmental consequences, such as satisfaction and transparency.

## 1.02.The Father of OKR's

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Andy Grove

:   *There are so many people working so hard and achieving so little.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this chapter, John tells us about the start of his professional career and how he got into Intel and met Andy Grove.

After that, he goes through the management history, beginning with Ford-Taylor, Drucker's MBO (management by objectives), and Grove's OKR.

Finally, he provides some pointers for using OKR:

-   **Less is more**, a few (3 to 5) good objectives are enough, and with of 5 KR maximum each;

-   **From the ground up**, begin defining goals from the ground up, rather than from the top;

-   **Team play,** you can impose goals, but discuss the key results**;**

-   **Be brave**, comfortable goals can be a safe zone for the team;

-   **Be adaptable**;if external factors change, why not update our OKRs?

-   **Not a weapon**, OKR's are tools to monitor our goals, and they should not be used as performance indicators.

## 1.03.Operation Crush: An Intel Story

This chapter recounts Intel's efforts to reclaim market leadership. In this case, the company restructures the marketing and sales teams in order to capitalize on their strengths and shift their sales focus away from programmers and toward CEOs.

We can see that the OKRs provided cohesion and transparency to the company operation, creating a sense of urgency but not despair, and they were able to reclaim their position as number one through this organization.

## 1.04.Superpower#1: Focus and Commit to Priorities

This chapter begins with a query:

*What is the most important thing for the next three (or six, or twelve) months?*

Answering this question is a starting point for truly understanding what matters; clarity in understanding the objective follows.

Aside from that, the key results must be measurable, either in terms of quantities to measure and achieve, or in terms of factual accomplishments that can be checked to see if they were completed or not by a yes or no question.

He cautions us not to become overly focused on unidimensional OKRs, as this may cause us to overlook other points of view. However, excessively greedy OKRs increase the risk of overlooking a critical aspect.

Some tips:

-   In dynamic markets, OKRs can be set every three months, but the period is flexible and must be tailored to each situation;

-   Measure both the effect and the side effect to avoid unanticipated consequences of achieving your goal;

-   To avoid the implication of having only a number to achieve, link a quantitative goal to a qualitative one;

-   Set three levels of OKR goals: achievable, possible challenge, and desire.

-   Avoid the temptation to have multiple objectives by limiting them to the most important ones.
