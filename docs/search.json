    "text": "In this post of the series Intro to, I’ll give an introduction to the Monty Hall problem.\n\nIntroduction\nBecause of its counterintuitive nature, it became a well-known probability scenario based on the game show “Let’s Make a Deal,” which Monty Hall hosted.\n\nIt functioned as follows:\n\nA player is presented with three doors, one of which hides a prize.\nInitially, the player selects one of the doors without knowing what lies behind it.\nAfter the player has made their selection, the host, who knows what is behind each door, opens one of the remaining two doors, always revealing a door that does not contain the prize.\n\nThe player is confronted with a quandary, they have the option of remaining with their original selection or switching to the other unopened door.\n\n\nWhy not 50/50?\nAt first glance, the probability of selecting the prize is 50% given the two remaining doors after the host opens one, so what the heck, right?\nThat is not the case; instead, let us map each scenario, where we have three doors (A, B, and C).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosen door\nPrize door\nHost opens\nSwitch the door\nStay with door\n\n\n\n\nA\nA\nB/C\nLose\nWin\n\n\nB\nA\nC\nWin\nLose\n\n\nC\nA\nB\nWin\nLose\n\n\nA\nB\nC\nWin\nLose\n\n\nB\nB\nA/C\nLose\nWin\n\n\nC\nB\nA\nWin\nLose\n\n\nA\nC\nB\nWin\nLose\n\n\nB\nC\nA\nWin\nLose\n\n\nC\nC\nA/B\nLose\nWin\n\n\n\nSwitching the door reveals 6 winning outcomes out of the 9 possibilities, whereas sticking with the original choice offers only 3 winning scenarios. This means that switching has a higher chance of success, with a 2/3 chance of success.\n\n\nStill skeptical?\nFor those who are still skeptical, here we simulate 200,000 games in R, where I chose to stay with the first door in the first half and switch the door in the second half.\n\ndoors <- c(\"A\",\"B\",\"C\")\n\nmonty_hall <- function(stay = TRUE){\n  \n  prize_door <- sample(x = doors,size = 1)\n  \n  initial_door <- sample(x = doors,size = 1)\n  \n  if(prize_door == initial_door){\n    switch_door <- sample(doors[doors != prize_door],1)\n  }else{\n    switch_door <- prize_door\n  }\n  \n  if(stay){\n    output <- initial_door == prize_door\n  }else{\n    output <- switch_door == prize_door\n  }\n  \n  return(output)  \n}\n\n#Probability of winning, by keeping the initial door\nset.seed(1234);mean(replicate(100000,monty_hall(stay = TRUE)))\n\n[1] 0.33282\n\n#Probability of winning, by switching the initial door\nset.seed(1234);mean(replicate(100000,monty_hall(stay = FALSE)))\n\n[1] 0.66718\n\n\nAs we can see, the simulation’s success probability is nearly equal to the previously calculated.\n\n\nConsiderations\nProbability and conditional reasoning are central to the Monty Hall problem. Choosing door A initially gives it a 1/3 chance of containing the prize, while the other unopened door, B, now has a 2/3 chance.\nDespite the fact that it seems counterintuitive, switching doors increases your chances of winning the prize. The puzzle is an enthralling example of how our intuition can lead us astray, emphasizing the importance of understanding probability in decision-making."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this post of the series An analysis of, I’ll do a data analysis of my favorite board game, Settlers of Catan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContext\nThe King James Bible, first published in 1611, is a crucial English translation of the Bible.\n“Hey, let’s have a fancy new translation!” exclaimed King James I of England. So he enlisted the help of a group of outstanding scholars. They were inspired by old English versions as well as the original Hebrew and Greek texts.\n\nFor the analysis we will use the text from the King James Bible.\n\nDisclaimer: the goal here is just to show and apply some techniques to work with text data.\n\n\n\nHow is the bible built?\nThis Bible is divided into two parts:\n\nThe Old Testament, which contains all of the religious material from before Jesus appeared;\nThe New Testament, which contains everything about Jesus and his followers.\n\nIn addition from the testaments, the bible is also divided in books and verses.\n\nAs we can see, the old testament has books with twice as many verses as the new testament. But, when we look by book, are the numbers of verses consistent?\n\n\nTestament\nBooks\nVerses\nVerses/Books\n\n\n\n\nOld\n39\n23,145\n593.4615\n\n\nNew\n27\n7,957\n294.7037\n\n\nTotal\n66\n31,102\n471.2424\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClearly not, as the number of verses varies greatly, with an outlier in the old testament, The Book of Psalms, having astounding 2,461 verses.\n\nBook of Psalms\n\n\n\n\nIt is a collection of religious songs, prayers, and poems attributed to King David of Israel as well as other authors such as Asaph, Korah’s sons, Solomon, and Moses.\nPraise, thanksgiving, trust in God, deliverance, longing for God’s presence, justice, and worship are just a few of the themes covered in the psalms. They are a rich source of spiritual reflection, expressing a wide range of human emotions and providing believers with comfort, guidance, and encouragement. The psalms are well-known for their poetic form, vivid imagery, and long-lasting spiritual and literary value, and they are widely used in Jewish and Christian worship.\n\n\n\nWith the exception of the last book, The Revelation of St. John the Divine, the new testament begins with books with a greater number of verses but decreases as the bible progresses.\n\nThe Revelation of St. John the Divine\n\n\n\n\nThe Book of Revelation, attributed to the apostle John, contains apocalyptic visions received by John while he was exiled on the island of Patmos.\nIt contains prophetic messages and symbolic language depicting the end times, final judgment, and God’s victory over evil. The book deals with topics such as faithfulness, persecution, divine sovereignty, and the establishment of a new heaven and earth. It contains messages to seven churches, heavenly worship, and predictions of future events, and it has sparked ongoing interpretation and fascination among Christians.\n\n\n\n\n\nWord-o-Rama\nNow let’s analyze the word frequency, the bible possess 789,649 words in total, where 12,784 are unique words. Here is the top 10 most frequent words:\n\n\n    Word Frequency\n1    the    63,925\n2    and    51,696\n3     of    34,617\n4     to    13,562\n5   that    12,912\n6     in    12,667\n7     he    10,420\n8  shall     9,838\n9   unto     8,997\n10   for     8,970\n\n\nThe result does not show much; to improve the outcome, we can eliminate this type of word; to do so, we have a dataset of stopwords.\n\nStopword\n\n\n\n\nA word that is commonly used in a language that is thought to have little or no meaningful information and is frequently removed from text during natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text analysis, information retrieval, or text mining. Articles (e.g., “a,” “an,” “the”), pronouns (e.g., “I,” “you,” “he”), prepositions (e.g., “in,” “on,” “at”), and conjunctions (e.g., “and,” “or,” “but”) are examples of stopwords.\n\n\n\nAfter removing this stop words we have 273,394 words total, of which 12,332, so just 452 stopword were removed, but that were used more than 516,255 times.\nNow, last see the top 10 most frequent words:\n\n\n     Word Frequency\n1    lord     7,830\n2    thou     5,474\n3     thy     4,600\n4     god     4,445\n5      ye     3,982\n6    thee     3,826\n7  israel     2,565\n8     son     2,370\n9    hath     2,264\n10   king     2,256\n\n\nWords referring to God appear, as expected, but how much of the old testament influences this?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph above shows the relative frequency of the most common words by testament; as a result, we can see that some words are shared, but we can also see which words diverge the most as we plot the identity line.\nFor example, “Jesus” and “Christ” appear only in the New Testament, which is no surprise, given the criteria for such division.\nOn the other hand, the word “lord” appears nearly three times more in the old testament, owing to the fact that God is a more prominent figure there.\n\n\nSentimental Scriptures\nThe text will then be classified as positive, negative, or neutral using sentiment analysis. This is accomplished by employing a third-party dictionary with a score assigned to each word.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that most books of the old testament have a negative sentiment, with a huge exception been the The Song of Solomon (book #22).\n\nThe Song of Solomon\n\n\n\n\nIt is a poetic dialogue between a bride and her beloved in which they express their deep affection and longing for one another through metaphorical language. The book celebrates the beauty of romantic love and is frequently interpreted as an allegory for God’s love relationship with His people. It contains vivid imagery and has sparked controversy due to its explicit content. Overall, it delves into themes of love, desire, and the beauty of human relationships, challenging readers to consider the nature of love and intimacy.\n\n\n\nThe first books of the new testament start negative, but became highly positive. But we can see that the penultimate book (The General Epistle of Jude) is more negative than the other final books.\n\nThe General Epistle of Jude\n\n\n\n\nThe General Epistle of Jude is a brief New Testament letter attributed to Jude, the brother of James and a disciple of Jesus Christ. It addresses the presence of false teachers and emphasizes the importance of discernment and faith. Jude warns believers about the consequences of false teachings and encourages them to fight for the true gospel. The letter encourages believers to strengthen their faith, to be compassionate toward those who doubt, and to praise God for His power and ability to keep them from falling. Overall, it is a call to stand firm in the face of false teachings and to rely on God’s grace and truth."

The number 4 had the biggest discrepancy, with observed values 1.02 percentage points below the predicted probability."
